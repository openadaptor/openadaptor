openadaptor 3.4.2
=======

Connectors
==========

 * JDBCReadConnector & JDBCWriteConnector - preambleSQL and postambleSQL properties
   renamed to afterConnectSql and beforeDisconnectSql, respectively. Setters for 
   the old properties were deprecated.

 * JDBCReadConnector - new properties preReadSql and postReadSql that get executed
   right before the actual SQL that returns a result set, and right after the result
   set has been read, respectively.

 * JDBCWriteConnector#connect - additional safety checks that allow a subclass 
   to choose to use the connection from this class at the same time not using
   the sqlWriter.
   
 * JDBCWriteConnector - the two ISQLWriter implementations MapTableWriter and
   MapCallableStatementWriter have moved to the new 
   org.openadaptor.auxil.connector.jdbc.writer.map package.
   
 * JDBCWriteConnector - two new ISQLWriter implementations, XMLTableWriter and
   XMLCallableStatementWriter added in org.openadaptor.auxil.connector.jdbc.writer.xml
   package.
   
 * LoopingPollingReadConnector and CronnableReadConnector - new 'reconnect' property.
   Setting it to false causes the underlying IReadConnector not to be physically
   reconnected on every poll (useful when the underlying reader is JDBCReadConnector). 
   
 * WebServiceListeningReadConnector - changed default namespace in the response.
   Exposed queueSize and queueLimit via JMX.  
   
Processors
==========
 
 * ExceptionToOrderedMapConvertor - 1. Correct detection of the message data type.
   2. New property 'convertPayloadToString' that allows for keeping message payload
   in its original form (default is true).

 * Added Legacy DataObject type filter (& corresponding example)

Examples
========

 * Added example of a Sybase event driven read connector 
   (example\spring\connectors\db\sybase\event.xml). 

 * Modified looping/cronnable connector examples as per comments above.
 
 * Added new example to illustrate how to mark data as processing/processed when
   reading from database (example\spring\connectors\db\reader2.xml)
   
 * Added example to illustrate how legacy 'Inspectors' may be approximated using scripts
   (example\spring\processors\script\script-inspector.xml)
   
 * Added examples for new ISQLWriter implementations in example\spring\connectors\db  
   (xml-table-writer.xml and xml-storedproc-writer.xml)

Miscellaneous
=============

 * Adaptor class has two static utility methods for programmatic invocation of adaptors.
   Simple.java (in example/src/...) demonstrates usage.
   
 * Adaptor class now supports an extra property "timeoutMs". This is a timeout measured
 	 in milliseconds which will be applied as an override to all connector read timeouts.
   
 * Migration guidelines (draft): www/migration.html 
 
 * DocumentMapFacade allows setting and retrieving prefixes for the default namespace. 
   This prefix can be used with xpath. See setDefaultNamespacePrefix(String prefix) 
   and getDefaultNamespacePrefix(). 
   
 * SpringAdaptor exits with a code based on Adaptor#exitCode (used to be 0).  
 	
 * The third party libraries that are used to construct openadaptor-depends.jar have 
   been move in the package from lib/3rdparty to lib/opt. This is to faciliate a 
   future mechansim which will allow automatic generation of the classpath, recursively 
   traversing the lib directory (tree) for jars.
   
Bug Fixes
=========

SC48: Transaction rollback when handling exceptions from IWriteConnectors.

SC53: A failed JMSConnection close does not clear the reference to the underlying jms connection.

SC53: ScriptProcessor fails when used with java 1.6. Symptoms are AbstractMethodErrors being thrown.

SC56: AdaptorRunConfiguration - transaction problem at restart.

SC57: Component lifecycle management problem when stopping adaptors externally.

SC59: DBEventDrivenPollingReadConnector doesn't participate in adaptor transactions.

SC60: DBEventDrivenPollingReadConnector skips every second row when an embedded JDBCReadConnector 
      has batch size set to one.
      
SC62: Checks if JDBC connection is active before performing a transaction rollback.      

3rd Party
=========

=================================================

Date: 17th April 2008
Author: openadaptor Core Team

openadaptor 3.4.1
=======

 Summary
 =======
 
 This release focuses on minor cleanup of the codebase & examples as well as some specific 
 changes as outlined below.
 

Processors
==========

 * Any processor that implements the ILifecycleListener interface will be notified 
   of state changes of its associated Node.
   
 * Added StringSubstitutor processor for escaping illegal XML characters.
 
Spring
======

 * We have upgraded to release 2.5.3 of the Spring Framework.   
  
Miscellaneous
=============

 * Clean up of JUnit tests e.g. warnings (unused imports, non-static references to static 
   fields, etc.) have been tidied.
   
 * Spring XML files with examples config renamed to follow industry standard (lower case,
   hyphen separated).
   
 * Failure to load .openadaptor-spring.xml from classpath is no longer fatal (reduced to warning).   
 
 * Added an ignoreExceptionProcessorErrors flag on the Router class. If set to true and an 
   exceptionProcessor is set on the Adaptor, any exceptions thrown by the exceptionProcessor
   will be logged only (they will not cause the adaptor to shut down).
   
 * New OAClient class may be used to send data into Openadaptor from a Java program. Added 
   examples: spring/client/*.xml.  
 
 * Moved .openadaptor.properties and registration.properties to top level of openadaptor.jar
 
 * Moved licence file licence.txt to top level
 
 * Extended the database schema for handling exceptions. Exception message,
   cause exception, exception stack trace, thread name (and more) are now recorded.
   Examples can be found in example\spring\exception\sybase\*.xml.
 
 * Added preambleSQL and postambleSQL to JDBCReadConnector
 
 * Added jtds-1.2.2.jar to lib 
 
 * A number of changes have been made to enable use of Declarative Transaction Management. 
   One JMS/JDBC example spring-local-txn-demo.xml has been added to example/spring/transaction.
 
 * WriteNode - new 'suppressDisconnectionErrors' property allows for preventing disconnection
   errors (IWriteConnector#disconnect) from being propagated to the Adaptor

Cleanup of Build Process
========================

 * Moved build tools into support area, and fixed package/directory setup.

 * Startup is more forgiving of locations of certain property files

=================================================

Date: 31st January 2008
Author: openadaptor Core Team

openadaptor 3.4
=======

Summary
=======

This release focuses on improving the documentation, the migration (from 1.x)
and on further stabilisation. It comes with a number of bug fixes and a new 
component type - an enrichment processor.

Connectors
==========

New IPollingReadConnector - ThrottlingReadConnector allows for throttling
of calls of read connector it wraps. The new connector is similar to 
the LoopingPollingReadConnector except it operates on more fine-grained level,
adding time intervals in between individual calls for data by the underlying
reader, rather than treating all calls (until source data is exhausted) of the 
wrapped reader as one call.

The deprecated PollingReadConnector has been deleted; all occurences need to be
replaced with either LoopingPollingReadConnector or CronnablePollingReadConnector.

|PollingReadConnector            | either LoopingPollingReadConnector or       |
|         (deleted)              | CronnablePollingReadConnector depending on  |
|                                | which mode (interval or cron) the           |
|                                | PollingReadConnector  was used in.          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Processors
==========

A new component type - an enrichment processor. Its goal is to 'enrich' its input 
with more data from an external resource. Standard read connectors are used to 
connect to and retrieve data from external resources.

* IEnrichmentProcessor represents a new type of component, on a par with IReadConnector, 
  IDataProcessor and IWriteConnector

* An enrichment processor needs to be able to a) prepare query parameters for 
  the underlying read connector, b) to interprete the results from the underlying 
  read connector and use them to 'enrich' the input data

* IEnrichmentReadConnector extends IReadConnector and represents a read connector 
  that can be plugged-in to an enrichment processor. IEnrichmentReadConnector requires 
  implementation of the next() method that accepts input parameters as an argument. 
  Some of the existing IReadConnectors were already altered to extend IEnrichmentReadConnector

* GenericEnrichmentProcessor is its generic implementation 

* JNDIEnhancementProcessor has been deprecated by GenericEnrichmentProcessor 

* Spring examples of a db based and file based enrichment processors are 
  in example\spring\processors\enrichment\*

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Legacy DataObjects / DOXML Conversion
=====================================

  * Significant refactor of legacy convertor code.
    Convertors now subclass AbstractLegacyConvertor which optionally provides a generic 
    mechanism to set attributes (properties) as spring bean properties on legacy convertors.
    Currently this includes ( XMLFormatter,GenericXMLWriter, GenericXMLReader)
    
  * Refactored conversion to DataObjects to use 'template' DOXML during conversion. This now
    permits correct generation of DataObjects/DOXML for consumption by legacy adaptors.
    
  * Added some extra legacy conversion examples also.
  
  *  Modified DataObjectToDOXmlConvertor to issue uniqueId by default (this mirrors default
    legacy adaptors behaviour)

Minor changes
=============

  * JDBCWriteConnector now defaults the sqlWriter in validate() instead of constructor.
    It also issues an INFO log message that it has done so.

  * Application now logs the jvm version near the beginning of adaptor 
    startup (in case adaptor dies before reporting it).

  * Minor improvement to the efficiency of AbstractFixedWidthStringConvertor. It now
    caches the field names rather than trying to work them out each time its asked.
    
  * Added a convenience subclass of RegexMultiLineReader (DOXMLReader) for reading 
    legacy DOXML which may contain multiple DOXML messages in sequence (the default 
    StringReader would only process the first DOXML message received)
   
  * Modified stub code to generate StubException when stub method is called. It still 
    extends RuntimeException but now can be distinguished if necessary.  
   
  * ServletContainer.setJettyServer(Server server) was nonsensical. Fixed.
  
  * Modified ScriptProcessor to allow returned arrays, adding a boxReturnedArrays property.
    boxReturnedArrays (default false) can be set to true to force legacy behaviour.  

  * Modified ScriptProcessor to allow specification of a Map of additional bindings. The
    entries in the Map will be used to bind names to object values, which may then be
    referenced within the script by those bound names.
    
  * Modified OrderedMapToDelimitedStringConvertor to allow for enclosing quotes to always 
    be output around the field (default false). This can be done by adding 
    a forceEnclosingQuotes property to true.  
    
  * JDBCConnection modified to allow for getting java.sql.Connection from a DataSource 
    looked up in the JNDI tree. This is done by setting dataSourceName and jndiConnection
    properties. Folder openadaptor\example\spring\connectors\db\jee\jboss\ contains an
    example.
    
  * FileWriteConnector has a new flag (addTimestampToMovedFile) that allows for appending 
    a timestamp to the moveExistingFileTo (name of the file the existing file is going to 
    be moved to). The default timestamp format can be overwritten.  
  
  * Added NullWriteConnector.
  
  * Modified ResultSet conversion to permit the use of column labels (aliases), by adding 
    a corresponding property. Based on a suggestion by browe. Thanks Brian :-)
    
Bug Fixes
=========

SC28: JDBC PreparedStatement writers should not use setObject(null), but setNull().

SC29: DB Event Mechanism error message for invalid SPROC is unclear
    
SC30: Remove need for constructor-arg on MBeanServer

SC31: DateHolder types should become java Dates when converting legacy DataObjects
      Added property to allow conversion of proprietary DataObject DateHolder types
      into java.util.Dates.
      The default value for this property is 'true' which means default behaviour will 
      differ from 3.3  
      
SC32: The pipeline DOXmlToDataObject -> DataObjectToOrderedMap will fail if the incoming
      DOXML contains more than one top-level data object. 
      Note that as a side-efffect, the default value for 'box returned arrays' in the
      AbstractConvertor class has changed from 3.3 (true) to 'false'.

SC33: JMSConnection cannot work without a valid JNDIConnection. This is because the
      connectors need to always lookup the JMS Destination. The Connectors have now
      changed to allow their destinations to be set directly if this is required.

SC34: (Bug (and patch for it) in OrderedMapToXMLConverter that does not allow to set a 
      slash substitution value)
      
SC35: OrderedMapToXmlConvertor should, but does not map slashes in the root tag 

SC36: MapCallableStatementWriter misses first argument for Oracle databases
    
Dependencies
============

  * log4j library upgraded from v1.2.9 to 1.2.15
  * JBoss jars were removed from lib/3rdparty  due to licence restrictions

JDBC Read Connectors & Polling Read Connectors
----------------------------------------------

JDBC read connectors and polling read connectors have undergone a significant 
rework: 

  * The concept of an IPollingReadConnector that wraps another read connector 
    has been introduced. An IPollingReadConnector basically defines the way the 
    underlying read connector will poll its resource. The idea follows the 
    Decorator design pattern and is similar to how input and output streams 
    can be 'wrapped' in the Java I/O API

  * Three implementations of IPollingReadConnector have been implemented: 
    LoopingPollingReadConnector, CronnablePollingReadConnector and 
    DBEventDrivenPollingReadConnector. The first two were based on the legacy 
    (now deprecated) PollingReadConnector. The last was based on 
    JDBCEventReadConnector.

  * JDBCPollConnector has been deleted and its role subsumed by 
    JDBCReadConnector.

  * JDBCEventReadConnector has been deleted. Its role is now shared between
    JDBCReadConnector and DBEventDrivenPollingReadConnector.

  * JDBCReadConnector now has the batching capability - result sets can be read 
    in batches of say, a 1000 records, rather than one by one, which should 
    increase performance. Batching is available via the batchSize property 
    (batchSize=0 means the entire result set is read in one batch, batchSize=1 
    means a batch will hold one element, batchSize=1000 means one batch holds 
    thousand elements etc).

  * XML and orderedmap ResultSetConverters were renamed to 
    ResultSetToXMLConverter and ResultSetToOrderedMapConverter respectively.

Since some of the classes were deleted and some renamed, certain changes need 
to be done to the existing deployed adaptors in versions 3.2.1 and 3.2.1.1 when 
upgrading them to version 3.3. The following table shows which classes need to 
be replaced in adaptors config files and how to replace them:

JDBCWriteConnector refactor
---------------------------

JDBC write connector has been completely refactored.
The old JDBCWriteConnector has been deprecated, and moved
into a deprecated package, along with all of its supporting
classes.

1. JDBC writer components now support database batching.
2. Prepared statements are reused where possible.
3. Behaviour has been expanded to permit the use of java.util.Maps
    (subject to some limitations)
4. The components now pass data transparently to the jdbc drivers
    (i.e. no artificial type-conversion)

Users should migrate existing usages as follows:

JDBCWriteConnector (deprecated) -> JDBCWriteConnector

Implementations of IStatementConvertor have been refactored (as
ISQLWriter) as follows:

SQLConvertor                    -> RawSQLWriter
PreparedStatementTableConvertor -> MapTableWriter
TableStatementConvertor         -> MapTableWriter
CallableStatementConvertor      -> MapCallableStatementWriter
SQLStatementConvertor           -> MapCallableStatementWriter + stored proc

The pre-existing implementations have all been marked as deprecated;
further use is actively discouraged.

Processors
==========

ScriptProcessor refactor
------------------------

ScriptProcessor has been refactored. It should now be used in place of
the deprecated javascript variants.

1. Compiled Script property has been removed (it is dependent on
   the ScriptEngine)

2. Script language now defaults to javascript ("js")

3. ScriptEngine is no longer settable. It is generated automatically
   during the validate() method. Subclasses may override generation
   through the createScriptEngine() method.

4. Comments and logging have been added.

5. The default binding for records has been changed from 'data' to
   'oa_data'. This reduces the likelihood of a conflict between field
   names and the record itself, particularly for MapScriptProcessor
   (see next section). Note that this may require some changes to existing
   adaptors which use ScriptProcessors (e.g. change data to oa_data 
   in scripts).

MapScriptProcessor added
------------------------

This allows direct access to entries in Map records from scripts. Again
this should prove more useful than the javascript equivalents (which
have been marked deprecated)

ScriptFilterProcessor & ScriptConditionProcessor refactoring

Both of these have been changed to use delegation rather than
inheritance from ScriptProcessor. This means that other ScriptProcessor
instances (e.g. MapScriptProcessor) may be uses with them.

Thus existing usage of thes processors will have to have their configs
altered to match - i.e. the ScriptProcessor becomes a property of the
filter/condition one. Behaviour should be unchanged.

Core
====

Exception Handling
------------------

The exception handling mechanism has been revised:

  * setting the exceptionProcessor property on the Router is now the only way 
    of manipulation of exception handling

  * exceptionMap, that allows for 'fine-grained' mapping between exception types
    and exception processing nodes is now set on ExceptionHandlerProxy class 
    rather than the Router.

  * exceptionList property setter has been removed from the Router (using 
    exceptionMap achieves the same purpose)

  * exception handler can now be made up of any number of nodes rather than
    always a single node

  * a concept of a message hospital has been introduced 

  * new section titled 'Step 11: Exception Handling' was added to the tutorial. 
    It explains the exception handling interface, different ways of configuring 
    the exceptionProcessor (including the message hospital) and provides 
    pointers to examples.

The following changes in adaptor configuration files are necessary to migrate 
from OA 3.2.1.x to 3.3:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|      OA 3.2.1.1                   |                 OA 3.3                   |    
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                   |                                          |
| setting 'exceptionMap'  property  | setting 'exceptionMap' property on the   |
| on the Router                     | ExceptionHandlerProxy which is then set  |
|                                   | as exceptionProcessor on the Router      | 
|                                   | (see EX 1)                               |
|                                   |                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

EXAMPLE 1.

OA 3.2.1.1:

<bean class="org.openadaptor.core.router.Router">
 ...
 <property name="exceptionMap">
  <map>
   <entry key="java.lang.Exception" value-ref="FileWriter"/>
  </map>
 </property>
</bean>

OA 3.3:

<bean class="org.openadaptor.core.router.Router">
 ...
 <property name="exceptionProcessor" ref="ExceptionHandler"/>
</bean>

<bean id="ExceptionHandler" 
      class="org.openadaptor.core.exception.ExceptionHandlerProxy">
 <property name="exceptionMap">
   <map>
     <entry key="java.lang.Exception" value-ref="FileWriter"/>
   </map>
 </property>
</bean>

Pipeline Deprecated
-------------------

The Pipeline class (org.openadaptor.core.router) has been
deprecated, and it's functionality promoted to the Router class.
(There was considerable confusion over the use of both classes,
and inconsistencies in the dual implementations.

It is still possible to define a pipeline, through the use
of the 'processors' property (this now delegates to a true
process map implementation).

ReadNode Refactored
-------------------

ReadNode has been refactored so that its IMessageProcessor implementation is
used by its IRunnable incarnation. This allows the two roles to be decoupled.
In future releases this will make the integration of openadaptor with container
managed resources much simpler.

Tests
=====

A move towards interface based unit tests has been made. This is still ongoing.

IDataProcessor interface testing
--------------------------------

The tests for this have been moved to the matching package (in the test
tree). Additionally, ScriptProcessor, ScriptFilterProcessor,
ScriptConditionProcessor & MapScriptProcessor now all extend the interface test.
Several other IDataProcessor implementations now include the interface testing 
(A few still remain to be modified however)

Other Interface tests
---------------------

Interface tests also exist in less complete form for IMessageProcessor, 
ILifecycleComponent, and ITransactionInitiator.

Miscellaneous & forum
===================== 

 * a public String getState() method added on the 
   org.openadaptor.core.adaptor.Adaptor class for JMX use (rwallsch).  

 * a public List getExitErrors() method added on the 
   org.openadaptor.core.adaptor.Adaptor class to allow for easier system testing
   of adaptors assembled 'by hand', i.e. not using Spring. The IRunnable 
   interface was extended by a new method: Throwable getExitError(). The method 
   was implemented in the only implementation that exists in OA: ReadNode.

 * an HTTP write connector and a HTTP read connector that polls an HTTP server 
   were added

 * SMTPConnection - added an optional mimeContentType property that allows to 
   configure the MIME type for the body of the message, or the attached body (tnd). 

 * AbstractDelimitedStringConvertor - new optional properties for escaping 
   quoted characters were added: escapeQuoteCharacters, quoteEscapeChar and 
   smartEscapeQuoteCharacters. 
   They allow for more fine-grained configuration of behaviour when the 
   protectQuotedFields flag is set to true

 * registerComponents call in Adaptor moved following feedback (rwallsch).
 
 * MqConnection.nextRecord bug (return immediately rather than wait for the 
   specified timeout)fixed (erik).

Bug Fixes
=========

Specifically bugs mentioned in Project Tracker.

SC20: JDBCReadConnector fails when participating in a JTA Transaction
SC22: Node attempts invalid cast when processing Exceptions


Known Issues
============

In addition to issues already noted in openadaptor.org's project tracker a 
number of issues have shown up in testing for this release. 

SC24: JTA Two phase commit
--------------------------

There seems to be a problem configuring an adaptor with an xa transacted reader
and writer using JOTM and Jboss MQ. This problem does not occur when JMS Grid 
is used in place of Jboss. The issue manifests as a forced rollback due to an
End Of File Exception. Its not known if this is merely a configuration issue
with the adaptor configuration file or a symptom of a deeper problem. More
investigation is needed to qualify this.


SC25: Unexpected fanout behaviour
---------------------------------

Input records may be modified by processors; in certain
circumstances this may cause unexpected behaviour in fanout/exception
handling situations. where a 'peer' component is incorrectly supplied
with a modified input record, rather than the expected 'unmodified' one.


SC26: Handling of exceptions from ReadNodes
-------------------------------------------

Exceptions thrown in ReadNodes are currently beyond the reach of OA exception
handlers. Even with an exceptionProcessor set, the adaptor will print stack 
trace to stdout and terminate. As a precaution only minimal read-specific 
functionality should be handled by ReadNodes, with all data processing 
behaviour delegated to separate ProcessorNodes.

SC27: Documentation is out of date & needs to be revisited
----------------------------------------------------------

The documentation doesn't properly reflect the significant changes made
in the last releases, and needs to be revisited.

openadaptor3 production 3.2.1.1 Release Notes

See licences/licence.txt for Licence information.
=================================================

Date: 7th June 2007
Author: openadaptor Core Team

openadaptor 3.2.1.1
=======

Summary
=======
This is the second production release of openadaptor 3.2.1

The openadaptor white paper can be downloaded from:

https://www.openadaptor.org/docs/whitepaper.pdf


This release focuses on fixing defects and some enhancements.

================================================================================


Enhancements
============

Documentation

  Jboss environment - 'Environment' section was added to the example/readme.html
  detailing versions of the JBoss application server successfully tested to work
  with those openadaptor examples that require a JMS implementation.


Configuration

  SpringApplication and SpringAdaptor have been enhanced to substitute for 
  system properties. Properties resources can be specified on the command line
  using one or more "-props <resource-name>" arguments. This is now the default
  behaviour. Default 3.2.1 behaviour can be reinstated by supplying "- noprops"
  as a command line argument.


Database

  TableStatementConverter has been modified to issue a warning and throw a 
  RecordFormatException when an incoming ordered map contains more fields than
  the output table it is writing to.


General Enhancements

  Legacy JMS 1.0.2 compliant connection code has been removed. We see no 
  advantage in maintaining this going forward.

  The Pipeline class has been refactored as a trivial subclass of Router. It is
  likely to be deprecated from the next release - Router already implements all
  of its behaviour and can be configured similarly if desired.

  PreparedStatementTableConverter has been added. This can offer significant 
  performance improvements over previous mechanisms by reusing a prepared 
  statement for multiple written data records.

  The exception manager/store has been temporarily removed. We intend to 
  refactor this to be easier to use and less reliant on webservices. In
  the meantime, exception handling and re-routing works as before using standard
  components. 

  We have begun the process of replacing usage of ISimpleRecord with Map
  instances. Ultimately this should allow generic processors which operate on 
  standard Maps.
 
  JDBCWriteConnector now allows preamble and postamble SQL to be executed before
  the connector starts processing records and after it finishes processing the
  last records, respectively.

  ScriptableSimpleRecord has been enhanced to support returned Object[] values.


Packaging

  The webservice tests have been removed as they are failing due to differences
  in the running environment. New tests will appear in due  course.


Defects

  SC13  Bug in OrderedMapToXmlConvertor - Conversion would fail if key could not
        be cast to a string as it used (String)key. Modified to use
        key.toString() instead which is considerably more optimistic.

  SC14  Bug in OrderedMapToDelimitedStringConvertor This was failing to convert
        non-String value objects to delimited strings. Now uses toString() to
        obtain its String representation

  SC15  Bug in Dom4J simple record processora - this would have failed if an
        attempt to put(key,null) was made.

  SC16  Bug in AbstractDelimitedStringConvertor - The mechanism for splitting
        strings was inconsistent; one character long delimiters were treated as
        either literal strings or regular expressions depending on the 
        delimited strings having quoted blocks in them.(blocks of text not to
        be broken up by the convertor even if they contained the delimiter)
        Users to specify via bean properties if the delimiter is to be always
        treated as a regular expression or always as a delimited string. For
        the default behaviour a one character delimiter (anticipated to be the
        case in most situations) is used as a literal string whereas longer
        delimiters are interpreted as regular expressions.
 
  SC17  Bug in AbstractDelimitedStringConvertor - it was dropping
        trailing empty elements.
        
  SC18  Null values in returned data will cause data to be lost. Fixed.
        
  SC19  OrderedMapToXMLConvertor could inadvertently have introduced illegal tag
        names in the generated XML. This would occur if an incoming key name
        contained a forward slash (/) character, which is illegal in XML tag
        names. Unfortunately dom4j does not detect this, and will generate XML
        with the illegal tag names. Subsequent parsing of the generated XML will
        fail however, by virtue of the illegal key name. Consequently, the
        mappedSlashValue property has been added. This specifies the value that
        will be substituted in place of slash characters in generated key names.
        By default this is implicitly set to DEFAULT_SLASH_SUBSTITUTE. Note that
        if the mappedSlashValue property is not explicitly set, a warning will
        issue each time a slash has been implicitly mapped (explicitly setting
        the mapped value will prevent such warnings).
