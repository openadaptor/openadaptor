<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>These instructions provide a step by step guide to getting started with OpenAdaptor. They require the
  reader to be able to install OpenAdaptor and the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), if it is not already
  installed.</p>

<!--
    Requirements
-->
<a name="requirements"></a>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>Openadaptor requires a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) or JDK (Java Development Kit) to be installed. 
  The minimum supported version of Java is 1.4. From the command prompt type the following to see what 
  version, if any, is installed:</p>
<pre>
  java -version
</pre>
<p>If Java is installed and your PATH environment variable includes the Java bin directory then you
  should see the version information. OpenAdaptor is currently built and tested with the following
  version:</p>
<pre>
  1.4.2
</pre>
<p>If you do not have Java installed or have a version prior to 1.4 then you need to install a new
  version. Please refer to <a href="http://www.java.com" target="_blank">http://www.java.com</a>
  for details on how to do this.</p>
<p class="back"><a href="#contents">back to contents</a></p>


<!--
    Logging
-->
<a name="logging"></a>
<h2>Logging</h2>
<p>Openadaptor uses the <a href="http://logging.apache.org/">Apache Commons Logging</a> services for 
  application debugging and auditing. More specifically, the log4j jar and config files are supplied as
  part of the OpenAdaptor distribution. The config file (log4j.properties) for this can be found in the
  <code>lib</code> directory.</p>

<p>In general this file can be left alone and will provide enough logging details for most applications.
  One common change that you may find useful is to turn on the debug log level. This is simplicity
  itself, simply modify the first line in the config file as follows:</p>

<pre>
  log4j.rootLogger     = DEBUG, A
</pre>
<p class="back"><a href="#contents">back to contents</a></p>


<!--
    Installation
-->
<a name="installation"></a>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The software for OpenAdaptor is distributed as a zip file. Installing it is simply a case of
  unzipping the contents. The installation should look like this:</p>

<pre>
  opendaptor-X.Y.Z
   |
   |- example         // README.txt and ant build file to compile code examples
   |   |
   |   |- bin         // scripts to set your Java classpath
   |   |- docs		  
   |   |- spring      // Spring framework example files
   |   |- src         // Java code examples
   |   |- tools		   
   |   |- tutorial    // a walk-through to illustrate adaptor creation
   |
   |- javadocs        // Java API documentation, launch index.html
   |   
   |- lib             // OpenAdaptor jar files and log4j properties file
   |   |
   |   |- 3rdparty    // 3rdparty jars/zips upon which OpenAdaptor and the examples depend
   |
   |- sql             // database schema and example files
</pre>
<p class="back"><a href="#contents">back to contents</a></p>


<!--
    Setting the Java classpath
-->
<a name="classpath"></a>
<h2>Setting your Java classpath</h2>
<p>Since OpenAdaptor is written in Java you need to set your Java classpath for things to work (this
  is how the Java Virtual Machine locates the Java classes it is instructed to run).</p>

<p>The nature of what OpenAdaptor does means that it ships with a large number of 3rd party jars, these
  can be found in lib/3rdparty. Some of these are used by the framework but many of these relate to the
  different things it is capable of connecting to and the different data formats it can process. To make
  life easy the majority of the third party jars are conflated into a single jar called
  <code>openadaptor-depends.jar</code> (this contains a manifest with the version of the 3rdparty jars
  that are included).</p>

<p>For most of the examples that we provide it is sufficient to set your classpath with the following:</p>

<pre>
  lib                          // so that the <a href="http://logging.apache.org" target="_blank">log4j</a> logging configuration is picked up
  lib/openadaptor.jar          // the OpenAdaptor code
  lib/openadaptor-spring.jar   // Spring specific helper classes
  lib/openadaptor-depends.jar  // subset of 3rd party jars upon which our core code depends
</pre>

<p>One of the ways in which Java will pick up its classpath is from an environment variable named
  <code>CLASSPATH</code>. The following instructions show how to set this in both a Windows command 
  prompt and a Unix (bourne shell):</p>

<h4>Windows command prompt</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  set OA_HOME=c:\openadaptor-X.Y.Z
  set CLASSPATH=%OA_HOME%\lib;%OA_HOME%\lib\openadaptor.jar;%OA_HOME%\lib\openadaptor-spring.jar;%OA_HOME%\lib\openadaptor-depends.jar
</pre></div>
   
<h4>Unix (bourne shell)</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  OA_HOME=~/opendaptor-X.Y.Z
  CLASSPATH=$OA_HOME/lib:$OA_HOME/lib/openadaptor.jar:$OA_HOME/lib/openadaptor-spring.jar:$OA_HOME/lib/openadaptor-depends.jar
  export CLASSPATH
</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively the example/bin directory contains two scripts for setting your classpath with absolute
  paths. The following instructions show how to run the respective scripts on both Windows and *nix.</p>

<h4>Windows command prompt</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  cd example\bin
  .\setclasspath.bat
  echo %CLASSPATH%
</pre></div>

<h4>Unix (bourne shell)</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  cd example/bin
  source setclasspath.sh
  echo $CLASSPATH
</pre></div>

<p>Some of the OpenAdaptor components require 3rdparty jar/zips that we can not distribute, typically
  for licencing reasons. So you will need to install these separately and add them to the classpath.
  Some of the example (Tibco and MQSeries) Spring configurations contain comments that relate to this.</p>

<p>post release 3.2.1, OpenAdaptor comes with an additonal jar called <code>bootstrap.jar</code>. This contains
    alternative helper classes that will bootstrap the classpath based on the location of the 
    jar file. All you need in your classpath is <code>bootstrap.jar</code>. You can dump out 
    the programs that can be run from this jar like this:</p>

    <div class="shell"><pre>  java -jar bootstrap.jar</pre></div>
    
    <p>This will print something similar to the following:</p>
    
    <div class="shell"><pre>  This jar contains the following programs :
    org.openadaptor.bootstrap.FileSystemExceptionManager
    org.openadaptor.bootstrap.JDBCExceptionManager
    org.openadaptor.bootstrap.SpringAdaptor
    org.openadaptor.bootstrap.SpringApplication
  When you run these they will bootstrap the classpath based on the location of this jar
  use -Dopenadaptor.lib=... to provide an additional location to search for classpath resources</pre></div>
    
    <p>These bootstrapping programs will automatically construct the classpath based on the location
    of <code>bootstrap.jar</code>. The classpath will contain all the jars, zip and subdirectories. 
    You can specify an additional directory to search using the <code>openadaptor.lib</code> system property. 
    Any <code>patch.jar</code> will always be placed at the front of the classpath, it will load 
    the contents of 3rdparty rather than <code>openadaptor-depends.jar</code>, and 
    <code>openadaptor-stub.jar</code> will always be at the end of the classpath.</p>
    
    <p>example 1:</p>
    <div class="shell"><pre>   java -classpath lib\bootstrap.jar org.openadaptor.bootstrap.SpringAdaptor -config foo.xml</pre></div>
    
    <p>example 2:</p>
    <div class="shell"><pre>  SET CLASSPATH=lib\bootstrap.jar
  java org.openadaptor.bootstrap.SpringAdaptor -config foo.xml</pre></div>
    
    <p>example 3:</p>
    <div class="shell"><pre>  SET CLASSPATH=lib\bootstrap.jar
  java -Dopenadaptor.lib=c:\tibco\tibrv\lib org.openadaptor.bootstrap.SpringAdaptor -config tibco.xml</pre></div>
  
<p class="back"><a href="#contents">back to contents</a></p>


<!--
    Verfiying the Installation
-->
<a name="verify"></a>
<h2>Verifying the Installation</h2>
<p>The best way to validate the previous steps is to run an adaptor. Here are the instructions (ensure
  that you are in the root of the OpenAdaptor distribution):</p>

<h4>Windows command prompt</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  cd example\spring\adaptor
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringAdaptor -config simple.xml
</pre></div>

<h4>Unix (bourne shell)</h4>
<div class="shell"><pre>
  cd example/spring/adaptor
  java org.openadaptor.spring.SpringAdaptor -config simple.xml
</pre></div>

<p>If everything works you should see a flurry of logging and the program will sit waiting for
  input. Anything typed at the prompt will be echoed. Type Ctrl-C to shutdown the adaptor.</p>

<p>If it didn't work then you will probably see a Java stack trace. The first things to check are that the
  command line you typed is correct and that your classpath is correct.</p>

<!--
    The Spring Examples
-->
<a name="spring"></a>
<h2>The Spring Examples</h2>
<p>Openadaptor is not dependent on the Spring framework, however it has been written to be
  Spring friendly. Previous versions of OpenAdaptor had a properties file based mechanism for
  initialising and wiring together the adaptor components, in the new version all the adaptor
  components have been written as beans, allowing Spring to be used to achieve the same result.</p>

<p>We advocate using the Spring framework to assemble adaptors. The majority of our examples are
  provided as Spring configuration files. Openadaptor provides a Spring specific helper class for
  running adaptors as a standalone process:</p>
<pre>
  org.openadaptor.spring.SpringAdaptor
</pre>

<p>This expects the following arguments:</p>
<pre>
  -config <i>url</i>   : where url points to a spring config, defaults to file:
  -bean <i>id</i>      : (optional) where id is the id of an Adaptor bean in the spring config file
  -jmxport <i>port</i> : (optional) if specified then runs default jmx mbean server and http adaptor
</pre>

<p>Upon startup the adaptor will generate logging output according to its logging configuration. Note
  that a running adaptor may be stopped by typing Ctrl-C on the command line (both Windows and Unix).
  Under normal circumstances this should cause the adaptor to terminate gracefully.</p>

<p>For more details on the examples look at the header comments in the Spring config file, or the
  README.txt if one exists in the example directory.</p>

<p>For more information on the Spring framework refer to 
<a href="http://www.springframework.org" target="_blank">http://www.springframework.org</a>.</p>

    The code examples
-->
<a name="code"></a>
<h2>The Code Examples</h2>
<p>The <code>src</code> dir contains code examples. The ant build file <code>build.xml</code> will 
  compile these examples. In order to run the compiled examples you will need to set your classpath 
  and include example/classes. Please refer to 
  <a href="http://ant.apache.org" target="_blank">http://ant.apache.org</a> if you are not familiar 
  with ant.</p>

<a name="tutorial"></a>
<h2>The Openadaptor tutorial</h2>
<p>The <a href="tutorial/index.html" target="_blank">tutorial</a> builds up a standalone example that
  illustrates the key concepts of OpenAdaptor and features of the adaptor framework.</p>

<!--
    The OpenAdaptor examples environment
-->
<a name="environment"></a>
<h2>Environment</h2>
  <p>Several tutorial examples require the availability of a JMS implementation. Those examples were 
  successfully tested with a default installation of the jBoss application server in the following 
  versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>jboss-3.2.8 SP1</li>
<li>jboss-4.0.0</li>
<li>jboss-4.0.5 GA</li>
</ul>

  <p>The tests were carried out on Windows XP, running OA v3.2.1 in the following versions of Sun's JVM:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.4.2 (1.4.2_14-b05)</li>
<li>1.5.0 (1.5.0_11-b03)</li>
</ul>

  <p>The tests will NOT run with jBoss 4.2.0.GA. This is due to the different version of logging libraries 
  used by the jBoss client and OpenAdaptor.</p>
